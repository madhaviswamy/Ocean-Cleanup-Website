    <p><em>The Ocean Cleanup</em>
      is a nonprofit engineering environmental organization based in the
      Netherlands, founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat, a Dutch-born
      inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian and Dutch origin who serves as its CEO.
      It develops technology to extract plastic pollution from the oceans and
      intercept it in rivers before it can reach the ocean. The organization
      conducts scientific research into oceanic plastic pollution. It has
      conducted two expeditions to the North Pacific Gyre, the Mega Expedition
      and the Aerial Expedition, and continues to publish scientific papers.

    <h2>Marine Plastic Debris</h2>
    <p>
      It is estimated that there is a stock of 86 million tons of plastic marine
      debris in the worldwide ocean as of the end of 2013, assuming that 1.4% of
      global plastics produced from 1950 to 2013 has entered the ocean and has
      accumulated there. 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in
      the world's oceans each year. Asia was the leading source of mismanaged
      plastic waste, with China alone accounting for 2.4 million metric tons. In
      2017 the UN estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in
      the oceans, if substantial measures are not taken.

      <p>
        Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. However, it has been
        found that plastic debris concentrates in the oceanic gyres where it
        forms extensive garbage patches. Of those, the North Pacific garbage
        patch is the biggest, with an estimated area of 1.6 million square
        kilometers. Plastic accumulating in these patches photodegrades into
        smaller and smaller particles and releases toxic and endocrine chemicals
        such as bisphenol A (BPA).
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and marine
      mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year. Larger plastics (called
      "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags can clog the digestive
      tracts of larger animals when consumed by them and can cause starvation
      through restricting the movement of food, or by filling the stomach and
      tricking the animal into thinking it is full. Microplastics on the other
      hand harm smaller marine life. For example, pelagic plastic pieces in the
      center of our oceanâ€™s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed
      up the food chain to reach all marine life as well as human consumers.

      <p>
        In 2011, aged 16, Dutch Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish
        while diving in Greece. He decided to devote a high school project for
        deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it was
        considered impossible to clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slat discontinued his aerospace engineering studies at TU Delft to
        devote his time to developing his idea. He founded The Ocean Cleanup in
        2013. The group's mission is to develop advanced technologies to rid the
        world's oceans of plastic. In June 2014, the Ocean Cleanup published a
        528-page feasibility study about the project's potential.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Ocean Cleanup is mainly funded by donations and sponsors. As of
        November 2019 it has made a little over $35 million from sponsors
        including Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, philanthropist Peter
        Thiel, Julius Baer Foundation and Royal DSM. The Ocean Cleanup raised
        over $2 million with the help of a crowdfunding campaign in 2014.

    <h3>Ocean Cleanup</h3>
    <p>
      The filtering system uses passive floating structures localized in the
      ocean gyres. These structures act as a containment boom. The floater
      drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to capture marine debris. A
      permeable screen underneath the float catches subsurface debris. The
      system is unmanned and incorporates solar-powered monitoring and
      navigation systems, including GPS, cameras, lanterns and an automatic
      identification system (AIS) for vessel traffic services.

        <div>
          <p class="caption">System 001/B in the ocean</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        System 001, deployed in September 2018, consisted of a 800 meters long
        barrier with a 3 meters wide skirt that hangs beneath it. System 001
        encountered difficulties retaining the plastic collected. After two
        month of operation, during which the system had collected 2,000
        kilograms of plastic, mechanical stress caused an 18-meter section of
        the structure to detach. After several months of root cause analysis and
        redesign, the organization employed System 001/B which could
        successfully capture and collect plastic, and even microplastics.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      At the end of July 2021, the organization revisited the Great Pacific
      Garbage Patch to trial System 002 -- a revamped version of the previous
      systems with an increased span of 1,600 metres. The new technology claims
      to capture 1,000 kg of plastics per day. As of 25 July 2022, The Ocean
      Cleanup announced to have removed a total of 100,000 kg of plastic from
      the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organization is now developing System 003, which is planned to have a
      three times bigger plastic intake than the current design. Unlike the
      previous prototypes, this new system is meant to be a blueprint for an
      entire fleet of filtering systems able to meet the scale of the problem.
    </p>

    <h3>River Interception</h3>
    <div>
      <div class="card tilt-right">

        <img class="box"

          alt="River Interceptor" />
        <div class="caption">
          <p>Interceptor in the Domenican Republic</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Responding to criticism that filtering devices closer to shore are
        easier to maintain, and likely to recover more plastic per dollar spent,
        the organization introduced an additional technology in October 2019 --
        the River Interpector. Solar-powered Interceptor vessels use floating
        arms to direct floating waste into the collection conveyor, which dumps
        trash into dumpsters on a detachable barge below. When full, the
        collection stops until the barge is removed, emptied and returned to the
        Interceptor.
      </p>


      <p>
        As of October 2022, The Ocean Cleanup enterntains eight Interceptors in
        Indonesia, Malaysia, Viet Nam, Dominican Republic, USA and Jamaica.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Plastic Recycling</h3>
    <p>In October 2020, The Ocean Cleanup launched their first product made from plastic collected from the Great
      Pacific
      Garbage Patch, The Ocean Cleanup Sunglasses. The organization worked with DNV GL to develop a certification for
      plastic from water sources and the sunglasses were certified to originate from the GPGP. Revenue from the sale of
      recycling products go into their continued cleanup projects.</p>
